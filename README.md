# Graphics-Engine
Final graphics engine for graphics class
# How to Use
$make

./mdl MDLFILE

# Implemented
- Lighting Commands
- light, constants, ambient

# Plans (in order of intended completion)
- ~~Lighting~~
- Shading
~~Gouraud~~
Phong
- Primitive Shapes: Cylinder, Cones
- Vary Modifiers (e.g. parabolic, exponential, logarithmic, polynomial, etc...)

# Less Important Plans
- Change scanline_conversion to use the helper functions

# Documentation
- 6/1/18- Finished Lighting

# Personal Notes
- Trying to implement DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- If Gouraud doesn't work, make unit tests (should be doing that anyway)
- Commit often
- ~~Intensities are messed up, look at all functions that deal with it(for Gouraud)~~
